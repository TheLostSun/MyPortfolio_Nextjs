      title="TATA ADAS Simulator"
      heading="Gamified driving experience highlighting six ADAS technologies for Tata Motors."
      content="I developed the Tata ADAS Simulator Game in Unity, showcased at the Bharat Mobility Auto Expo, Pragati Maidan. Designed to highlight six key Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) features, the game let visitors drive a virtual car around a small island, experiencing scenarios that demonstrated safety and driver-assist technologies in action. Players were scored based on their accuracy and responsiveness, making the experience both educational and engaging. The project effectively transformed complex automotive technology into an immersive, gamified showcase, reinforcing Tata Motors’ commitment to innovation and safety while providing me with an exciting opportunity to blend game design with real-world tech.

      content="I developed the Samudra Manthan VR Game for the upcoming Mahakumbh 2025 Mahakumbh Center, designed to blend cultural storytelling with modern immersive technology. In this interactive experience, participants virtually take part in the legendary Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean) by pulling Vasuki, the serpent, using VR controls. As the churning progresses, users witness and collect the divine elements and treasures emerging from the ocean, making the mythological tale both informative and engaging. The project highlights how virtual reality can preserve and reimagine ancient stories, transforming them into memorable, participatory experiences for audiences of all ages.
